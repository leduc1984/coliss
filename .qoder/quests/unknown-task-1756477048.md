# Pokemon MMO - Character and Map Editor Issues

## Overview

This document analyzes two critical issues in the Pokemon MMO Omega Ruby Style project:

1. **Character Control Problem**: The character is displayed correctly (from behind with red cap and backpack) but keyboard inputs are not properly processed, showing "w w s s" instead of responding to actual key presses.

2. **Map Editor Problem**: When trying to use the map editor, users encounter a dark interface with a grey box asking them to "Choose a Pokemon" instead of the expected map editing tools.

## Architecture

The project follows a client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: Babylon.js for 3D rendering in both main game and map editor
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and Socket.io for real-time communication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data persistence

## Issues Analysis

### 1. Character Control Problem

#### Problem Description
The character is displayed correctly (from behind with red cap and backpack) but keyboard inputs are not being properly processed. Instead of responding to actual key presses (WASD), the system shows "w w s s" as literal characters.

#### Root Cause Analysis
Based on code analysis, the issue likely stems from:

1. **Focus Management Conflict**: The chat system and player controls are competing for keyboard input focus.

2. **Event Handling Issues**: Conflicts in how keyboard events are processed between components.

3. **Input Map State**: The input map in `PlayerController` may not be properly updating when keys are pressed.

#### Technical Details
- Player controls managed by `PlayerController` class in `public/js/player.js`
- Keyboard event listeners attached directly to the window
- Chat system in `public/js/chat.js` manages focus state
- The `handleKeyDown` method should process WASD keys for movement

### 2. Map Editor Problem

#### Problem Description
When accessing the map editor, users see a dark interface with a grey box prompting "Choose a Pokemon" rather than the expected map editing tools.

#### Root Cause Analysis
Based on code analysis, the issue likely stems from:

1. **Initialization Failure**: The map editor is not properly initializing its UI components.

2. **Asset Loading Problems**: Critical assets required for the map editor may not be loading correctly.

3. **Pokemon Data Integration**: Issues with how Pokemon data is being loaded or selected.

#### Technical Details
- Map editor UI defined in `pokemon-map-editor/index.html`
- Main editor logic in `pokemon-map-editor/editor.js`
- Pokemon data handling managed by `pokemon-map-editor/pokemon-data.js` and `pokemon-map-editor/pokemon-sprites.js`

## Solution Approach

### Character Control Problem Fix

1. **Focus Management**:
   - Ensure proper focus switching between chat input and game canvas
   - Implement explicit blur/focus events when toggling between chat and movement

2. **Keyboard Event Handling**:
   - Review and fix event listener conflicts in `PlayerController`
   - Ensure key events are properly captured and processed

3. **Input State Management**:
   - Verify the inputMap is correctly updated when keys are pressed/released
   - Add debugging to track key event processing

### Map Editor Problem Fix

1. **Initialization Sequence**:
   - Check that all UI components are properly initialized
   - Verify Pokemon data loading sequence

2. **Asset Loading**:
   - Confirm all required assets are available and loading correctly
   - Add error handling for missing assets

3. **UI State Management**:
   - Ensure the "Choose a Pokemon" prompt only appears when intentionally triggered
   - Fix UI visibility and component rendering
