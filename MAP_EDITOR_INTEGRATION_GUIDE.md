# 🎉 Map Editor Integration - What's New!

## ✨ Major Update: No More Separate Server!

The Pokemon MMO map editor has been **completely integrated** into the main game. This means **no more hassle with separate servers** and **streamlined development workflow**.

## 🚫 What's Changed (No More Separate Server)

### ❌ **OLD WAY** (Before)
```bash
# Had to start TWO servers:
npm start                     # Main game (port 3000)
cd pokemon-map-editor && npm start  # Editor (port 3001)

# Then navigate to TWO different URLs:
http://localhost:3000         # Main game
http://localhost:3001         # Map editor
```

### ✅ **NEW WAY** (Now)
```bash
# Start ONLY ONE server:
npm start                     # Everything runs on port 3000

# Access everything from ONE URL:
http://localhost:3000         # Main game + integrated editor
```

## 🎮 How to Access the Map Editor Now

### For Admins/Co-Admins:
1. **Join the main game** at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Login** with your admin account (e.g., `leduc`)
3. **Press the 'E' key** to open the integrated map editor
4. **Start editing** immediately - no additional setup required!

### New Keyboard Shortcuts:
- **'E' Key**: Open/close integrated map editor (Admin only)

```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **Editor Won't Open**
